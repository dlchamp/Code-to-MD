# Code to Markdown for Visual Studio Code

A simple tool that will take your selected/highlighted code snippet from within VS Code, format it for Reddit or Discord markdown before placing it on your system's clipboard, ready to paste in either program.

The goal of this extension is to provide a utility that helps users always have nicely formatted code blocks when asking for help within various help/support servers and subreddits. 

## Instructions

1. Select a snippet of code from your project
2. Right-click and Select `Copy to Discord` or `Copy to Reddit`
3. Paste the selected and now formatted code within a Reddit post or comment, or Discord chat box.
